Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

The package is based on the `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ scripting
language and the `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ Python-based ecosystem.
You will need a working Python installation including the SciPy library and
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_.

ximpol also uses `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_ for a few things (most
notably the
`astropy.io.fits <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/index.html>`_
module for manipulating FITS files), so you'll need that as well.
